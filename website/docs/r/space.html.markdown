# cf\_space

Provides a Cloud Foundry resource for managing Cloud Foundry [spaces](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html) within organizations.

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires the provider to be authenticated with an account granted org manager permissions.


## Example Usage

The following is a Space created within the referenced Org. All referenced users must have been added as a member to the owning Org.

```
resource "cloudfoundry_space" "s1" {
    name = "space-one"
    org = "${cloudfoundry_org.o1.id}"
    quota = "${cloudfoundry_quota.dev.id}"
    asgs = [ "${cloudfoundry_asg.svc.id}" ]
    managers = [
        "${cloudfoundry_user_org_role.tl.user}"
    ]
    developers = [
        "${cloudfoundry_user_org_role.tl.user}",
        "${cloudfoundry_user_org_role.dev1.user}",
        "${cloudfoundry_user_org_role.dev2.user}"
    ]
    auditors = [
        "${cloudfoundry_user_org_role.adr.user}",
        "${cloudfoundry_user_org_role.dev3.user}"
    ]
    allow_ssh = true
