# cf\_route

Provides a Cloud Foundry resource for managing Cloud Foundry application [routes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html).

## Example Usage

The following example creates an route for an application.

```
resource "cloudfoundry_route" "default" {
    domain = "${data.cloudfoundry_domain.apps.domain.id}"
    space = "${data.cloudfoundry_space.dev.id}"
    hostname = "myapp"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `domain` - (Required, String) The ID of the domain to map the host name to. If not provided the default application domain will be used.
- `space` - (Required, String) The ID of the space to create the route in.
- `hostname` - (Required, Optional) The application's host name. This is required for shared domains.

The following arguments apply only to TCP routes.

- `port` - (Optional, Int) The port to associate with the route for a TCP route. Conflicts with `path` and `random_port`.
- `random_port` - (Optional, Bool) Set to 'true' to create a random port. Conflicts with `path` and `port` and defaults to false.

The following argument applies only to HTTP routes.

- `path` - (Optional) A path for a HTTP route.

The following maps the route to an application.

- `target` - (Optional) A route mapping that will map this route to an application

  - `app` - (Required, String) The ID of the [application](/docs/providers/cf/r/app.html) to map this route to.
  - `port` - (Optional, Int) A port that the application will be listening on. If this argument is not provided then the route will be associated with the application's default port.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The GUID of the route
* `endpoint` - The complete endpoint with path if set for the route
